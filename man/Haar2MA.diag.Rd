\title{Generate 2-D Haar MA process (diagonal/vertical/horizontal direction).}
\description{
These functions generate an arbitrary number of observations from a Haar MA process of any order with a particular variance. We will focus here on 
\code{Haar2MA.diag} --- the routine which generates processes having spectral structure solely in the diagonal decomposition direction.
}
\usage{
Haar2MA.diag(n, sd = 1, order = 5)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n}{The dimension of the realisation that you want to create. Note that \code{n} does NOT have to be a power of two, though it is square 
(nxn).}
  \item{sd}{The standard deviation of the innovations.}
  \item{order}{The order of the MA process.}
}
\details{
A two-dimensional Haar MA process is a special kind of moving-average (MA) field. A \emph{diagonal} Haar MA process of order $k$ is a MA field of order $2^k-1$, the coefficients of the process being given by the filter coefficients of the two-dimensional, discrete Haar wavelet at various scales within the diagonal direction. For example: the diagonal Haar MA field of order 1 is an MA process of order 1. 
It is possible to define such processes for other wavelets as well.

}
\value{
A matrix containing a realisation of the specified dimension, order and standard deviation.
